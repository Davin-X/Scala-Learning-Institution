### **🔄 Path Integration & Complementarity**

The two paths are designed to **complement each other**:

- **Scala Language → Spark Ecosystem**: Master Scala first, then apply it to big data
- **Full-Stack Scala**: Combine both paths for complete Scala expertise  
- **Career Flexibility**: Start with one path, expand to the other as needed

**Cross-Path Learning Flow:**
```
Scala Language Fundamentals → Spark with Scala → Advanced Scala Features
     ↓                           ↓                          ↓
Backend Development       Data Engineering         Full-Stack Scala
```
