Hello, World!
Welcome to the Scala File Processor application.

This is a comprehensive example demonstrating various Scala features and capabilities.

The application showcases:
- Command-line argument parsing
- File input and output operations
- Text processing and analysis
- Algorithm implementation
- Parallel processing support
- Professional logging and error handling

Scala is a powerful programming language that combines functional programming with object-oriented principles.

It provides excellent support for:
- Type safety and inference
- Pattern matching
- Immutable data structures
- High-order functions
- Operator overloading
- Macros and metaprogramming

The learning journey includes:
1. Basic syntax and data types
2. Control structures and loops
3. Functions and methods
4. Collections and sequences
5. Case classes and pattern matching
6. Traits and inheritance
7. Futures and asynchronous programming
8. Testing with ScalaTest
9. Big data processing with Spark
10. Macros and compile-time programming

Interview preparation covers essential algorithms and data structures used in technical interviews.

This sample text demonstrates word processing, frequency analysis, and various string operations that the application can perform.
